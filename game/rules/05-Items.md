## Robot Slave

Three separate cards compose the Robot Slave. Once a player collects all parts of them, they may activate it. Once activated, the Robot Slave becomes like a second player, controlled by the player who activated it. A player can only control up to 2 Robot Slaves at a time. A Robot Slave has the following properties:

- Starts with 5 HP.
- Cannot gain HP, though it can wear armor.
- Can equip a weapon.
- Has its own hand but does not start with any items.
- Can freely exchange item cards with its master so long as they are on adjacent spaces connected by a tunnel.
- Can engage in combat with other players and other Robot Slaves.
- Cannot activate another Robot Slave.
- For the _dig_ action, must only roll a 5-6 for _random digging_ or a 8-12 for _directed digging_.

## Cave Orphan

A Cave Orphan is a dirt-covered beastchild that can be used to disarm traps. When activated, a Cave Orphan can move up to 3 spaces to a space with a _trap_ set on it. The player rolls 1d6 to decide the fate of the Orphan. A roll of 1-4 destroys both the trapped item and the Orphan. On a roll of 5-6, the Orphan returns to the player with the item.

## Dirt

Dirt.

## Spikes

A **Trap** Card. Does 1 damage to a player who steps on them unless they have special shoes or something that prevent this.

## Bomb

A **Trap** Card. Does 3 damage when tripped, though an armor bonus can reduce it. When tripped, player rolls 1d6. On a roll of 1-2, a cave-in occurs. Tile is replaced randomly by another tile from the deck and is then rotated 1d6 times.

## Knife

A _weapon_ that does 2 HP of damage.

## Letter of Acknowledgement from the Foreman

+2 to HP.

## Mattock

A digging tool. Can be used once and discarded to rotate any one adjacent or current tile. Alternativelt can be used as a _weapon_ that does 1 HP of damage. The mattock can be used to dig while equipped but must still be discarded.
