# Combat

When a player enters the same space as another player, they may engage them in _combat_!

Combat may not end with two living players on the same tile. If the agressor's movement ends in the space of another player, combat must ensue, but both players may opt to disengage.

## Turn Order

The player who enters the space may take the first turn in combat or, alternatively, elect not to engage. However, if the invading player (agressor) elects not to engage, the invaded player (defender) still has the option to engage and take the first turn. For one player to pass through the space of another player, both must elect not to engage the other. If either chooses to engage, combat proceeds alternating between the two players until one disengages or dies.

## Combat turn

A player can do one of the following on their turn:

- **Attack** - Use equipped weapon to attack the other player. If the agressor is attacking and has remaining movement, this counts as moving one space.
- **Use an Item** - Use one item from their hand. This item may not be placed as a trap on the current space. If the agressor uses an item and has remaining movement, this counts as moving one space.
- **Disengage** - If a player chooses to disengage, both players roll _1d6_. If the disengaging player's roll is greater than the other player's, the disengaging player may flee a number of spaces equal to the difference between the two rolls (plus any remaining movement if they are the invading player). Combat does not necessarily end on a successful disengagement (See _Chase_).
  - There is a possibility that a player may flee into combat with another player. If this happens, treat it as an ordinary combat encounter. If these two players engage in combat and the previous agressor is able to successfully _chase_ into the same space, add that player as third in the turn order.
- **Chase** - If the defender has sucessfully disengaged and the agressor has remaining movement, they may use that remaining movement to _chase_ the other player. If they are able to move into the defender's space with this movement, combat resumes and the chasing player may _attack_, _use an item_, or _disengage_.
- **Dig** - On any turn, a player may attempt to manually dig through a wall. This is especially useful in the event of a cave-in when no proper digging items are available. There are two options available for digging out of a space:
  - _Random digging_: If your aim is simply to get out of a space, you may strike out into a random direction. Roll _1d6_. If you roll a 6, select an adjacent space and roll an additional _1d6_. For your dice roll, move to the nth tile clockwise from the space you selected. (The space you selected for a roll of _1_, the space clockwise of the space you selected for a roll of _2_, etc.) If you end up not even going through a wall, it's not totally your fault; it's dark underground.
  - _Directed digging_: If you want to get to a specific adjacent space, roll _2d6_. On a roll of 10-12, move to any adjacent space.
