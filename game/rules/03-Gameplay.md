## Gameplay

### Tunneling Phase

In the first phase of the game, players build the map. It is played in rounds until the entire board is filled with tiles

#### Beginning of round

- All **initiative tokens** are returned to pool.
- All players roll 1d20 initiative roll
- Player with highest initiative roll chooses **initiative token** from pool
- Players do their thing in order of lowest initiative token.

#### Player Turn

- Roll **2d6**
  - High number is the **draw number**
  - Low number is the **play number**
- Draw a number of hexagonal tiles equal to your draw number.
  - These can be taken from any stack and can be looked at immediately
- For a play number of 1, draw one item card.
- For a play number of 2-3, draw one item card (face down for now)
- For a play number of 4-6, draw two item cards (face down for now)
- Option for play numbers of 1-6:
  - Put item cards in your hand and look at â€˜em.
  - Play a number of hexagonal tiles equal to your play number on any spaces adjacent to any tiles contiguous to your home space.
  - On any of these spaces, play a number of items equal to the number of item cards drawn this turn, placing no more than one item on any space. These items may be placed as **caches** or as **traps**.
- Option for play numbers of 2-6:
  - Draw an additional item card. Keep all item cards drawn on this turn face down and separate from your hand.
  - Play a number of hexagonal tiles equal to your play number on any spaces adjacent to any tiles contiguous to your home space.
  - Without looking at them, play all item cards drawn on this turn as _traps_ on spaces that you just placed, placing no more than one item on any space.
- Discard all but 6 hexagonal tiles. You should have exactly 3 item cards and 6 tiles at the end of your turn.

### Murdering Phase

_Discard 0-3_ of your item cards and then draw until you have _6 item cards_ in your hand.

Similarly to the tunneling phase, the murdering phase is played in rounds. The object of the game is to be the last player alive.

#### Beginning of Round

- Decide initiative the same way as in the Tunneling Phase

#### Player Turn

- **Speed** - Roll 1d6 and add any speed bonuses to determine the number of spaces you can move. You can move up to this many spaces but need not move the full amount.
- **Spring Traps** - If you move into a space where a trap has been placed, you must spring that trap (unless you have an item that allows you to avoid it) _even if you placed it_. If it is a trap card, resolve it with yourself as the target. If it is not a trap card, you may collect it as if it were a cache.
- **Place Items** - You may place any item in your hand on any space you visit, including the ones you start and end on. These items may be placed as _caches_ or _traps_.
- **Gather Caches** - You may gather cached item on any space you visit. Once gathered, you may look at it and choose to keep it in your hand or activate it.
- **Battle Folks** - If, on your turn, you move into the same space as another player's character or one of their minions, you may engage them in _combat_.

## Winning

To win the game, a player must be the last living and non-trapped player.

Once all but one player are dead or unable to move, all players unable to move are given _one additional round_ to attempt to dig out of their eternal tombs. If any player frees themselves, even if into another trapped space, play resumes. If all players fail to free themselves, play ends and the free player is declared the winner. Also, I guess, the sounds of celebration enrage the gamma-exposed moles who then drain the blood from all those still trapped in the walls... which explains why they can't just keep trying to dig out. They would need blood for that.
