## Board

The game is played on a hexagonal grid. A variety of maps may be created, but the standard map is a 10x10x10 hexagon. Home spaces are centered on each side one row from the edge. Home spaces are numbered from 1-6 in clockwise order for position selection purposes.

## Character Tokens

Tokens to represent each character on the Board

## Robot Slave Tokens

Tokens to represent Robot Slaves on the board.

## Cup of Initiative Tokens

A cup of initiative tokens for randomly choosing turn order in each round.

### Initiative Tokens

Initiative tokens to designate turn order. Are drawn at the beginning of each round and kept for the duration of the round.

## Player Boards

Each player has their very own board for managing individual gameplay. This board has the following things on it:

- **HP Tracker** - Used to track player HP, the HP Tracker is composed of 21 little squares or dots labeled from _Dead, 1, 2, ..., 19 20_. A marker is initially placed on _10_ but players can gain or lose HP throughout the game. HP may never exeed 20.
- **Item Index** - The item index is _20_ Item Card-shaped "slots" that are labeled from 1-20. Each space has a corresponding marker of the player's color. When an item is placed on the board, the card is placed in the Item Index slot and the corresponding marker is placed on the board in either the _cache_ or _trap_ configuration.
- **Weapon Slot** - A weapon must be equipped to be used. To be equipped, a weapon card is placed in the weapon slot.
- **Armor Slot** - Similarly to the Weapon Slot, an Armor item can be equipped and placed in the Armor Slot. Armor must be equipped before it is used.
- **Initiative** - A handy little spot to keep your _initiative token_.
