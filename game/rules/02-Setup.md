# Setup

- Decide player placement
  - Example:
    - Players draw initiative tokens to determine home space positions.
      - (_Optional house rule_: winning player chooses where to sit or elects to try again and allow next player to choose, possibly cascading down to player with losing roll.)
- Divide hexagonal tiles into approximately equal stacks equal to the number of players and place one stack next to the edge of the grid in front of each player, **face down?**
- Divide rectangular item cards into approximately equal stacks equal to the number of players and place one stack next to the corner to the left of each player
- Place initiative tokens for number of players in **initiative token pool**
  - 1 and 2 for 2 players, 1-4 for 4 players, all tokens for 6 players, etc.
- Each player does the following:
  - Places character piece on starting position for chosen sextant.
  - Draws 3 item cards
  - Draws 6 hexagonal tiles
